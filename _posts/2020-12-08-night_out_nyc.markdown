It goes with out saying, but the title is very close to what I'd love to do sometime soon; go out in NYC and enjoy it again.  With that said I feel that anybody who wishes to do these things need to have a way of getting it done.  So one has to search for what's good in the city.  

I put together and application that does just that.  Night Out NYC is fully about finding the next best adventure through restaurants and hot spots.  The user can go on and check out whats new.  More so, the user can share their experience through a comment and star rating.  

Not only can the user do these things, they can find places that are in the particular nieghborhood they find exciting. 

What I found difficult this time around was the DIVs.  More than halfway through I realized that I did do as much dynamic expressions as I thought I would.  So I believe that thats one of my downfalls.  I think that I could have for sure used the dynamic ways of creating elements to make for a more cohesive application, but I will work on it for the next runner up.  

Overall this was and revisit to the excitment I had doing the first api project and am not ready for the last module.  Cheers!
