I think it took a few re-reads to figure out conditionals but it is quite interesting.  I was stuck on hashes lab and I didnt understand that the whole methoded needed to be returned in an Array.  Well, I did understand that but I didnt get how to gel it all together.  I figured it out with the help of a classmate but redid it my way.  The main thing I understood was the condition.  If key.includes? "BBQ"  .  I think I will read over all the lessions again to get more depth knowledge with my free time.  On to the next.
