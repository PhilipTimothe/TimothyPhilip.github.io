I am figuring things out but havent so far.  

My project is a simple application that involves bucket listing.  We all might have a bucket list because over time we all aspired to do particular things that we most times dont get to.  For example, I want to go to Egypt which seems like a amazing experience but time has proven that the American grind can push desires like that to the side.  Really these things are adventures I will take but havent, so it is put into a bucket list of things I will do.

The application is exactly that, a bucket list.  The user can sign up and once signed up the user can add anything goal to their own personal list.  The user has to sign up with an chosen user name, email, and password.  They can add a goal and edit or delet it.  

While coding the app I ran into issues.  I originally wanted to expand the application onto mutliple levels.  I wanted the user to be able to create multiple user bucket lists and name them.  With in the list you would then be able add the goal, edit the goal, and so forth.  The problem was I couldnt figure out how to connect the goal controller to the bucketlist controller.  Also, figuring out the has many relationship structure for the application prove difficult.  So, becuase time what starting to run away from me I decided to simplify the application.

What I now understand is that the creative aspect of what I am capable depends on time availablity in particular to myself.  I am working again and reacclimating to current conditions is possible but has been a struggle so far.  It all means less time for studying and more time focused on actual obligated work along with my other responsiblities.  

I will say, this project is an eye opener and that is what I understand now.
