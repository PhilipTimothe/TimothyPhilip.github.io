Its been a learning curve.  Ive learn quite a bit in the past two weeks.  Ive learned that I probably wont make it through the process if I work how I do now.  I work nights at a night club and it takes a great toll on me physically and mentally.  I realized that it wont help because I want to finished in 10 months.  I also dont want to fall way behind on my own personal timeline.  So far its a lot to think through and I am doing a lot of thinking.  I havent made it to the end of the first mile successfully and now I guess I need to wait for the next part considering this is my first cohort.
