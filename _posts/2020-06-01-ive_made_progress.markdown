Currently working on the CLI project and it hasnt been too bad.  I understand a lot of the material and I know I will get better at it all.  My issues dwell in recognition of methods and know when to utilize them.  I want to have a strong grasp of the concept but its a little above my weight class for the moment.  In my case, I have always had to take a little more time to understand material.  I have had to restudy note and learning modules all my life.  Its a cycle but I understand that its the key to my learning.  They say musicians are good at learning code but I dont really see it in action, which is really funny to me.  On a even different note, the things that are happening outside of coding has been extremely disturbing and disappoint to me.  It make focusing on learning code difficult.  Its like why should I even try when someone like me and my complexion might have more stacked against him even after succeeding in this program.  Despite it all, I am fired up to work hard and get it done.  I only want a few things and this is one for sure.  Welp, until next time...
