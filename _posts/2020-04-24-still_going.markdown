The days seem shorter every day I wake up.  Its like none of this quarantine issues arent even happening because I am still looking for more time in a day like I was before it all.  That is my issue I think.  Poetically I am at odds with myself trying to manage other facits of my life with this new part.  Before I would work nights and be exhausted with my days while studying this amazing craft of technology, while continuing to breath in the realm of my other passions.  Even now I still do the same.  I wake up and try to fill every minute and second with things I have to get done, with things that I am passionate about, and things that are important like family and health.  At the end of it all, I can say that I am still going.
