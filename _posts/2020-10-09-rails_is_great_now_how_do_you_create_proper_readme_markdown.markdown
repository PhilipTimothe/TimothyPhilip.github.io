So I dont actually know the correct way to do a read me but here is what Ive gotten so far---

# Mechanic Book 

This application is intended for the purpose of management of mechanic facility vehicle repair. 

## Table of contents

- [Quick Start](#quick-start)
- [What's Included](#whats-included)

## Quick Start

- Clone Repo `https://github.com/TimothyPhilip/Mechanic_Book.git`

- Run Bundle to install gems 

## What's Included

Within the application you'll find that Rails on Ruby is the interpretation being implemented against.  Active Record database usage and building from Sinatra is ideally the goal of this project application.  From the basic created structure of Rails you'll find the following directories and files in logical REST and CRUD convention.  Basic construct is as follows: 

```text
mechanic_book/
└── app/
    ├── controllers/
    │   ├── application_controller
    │   ├── mechanics_controller
    │   ├── repairs_controller
    │   ├── sessions_controller
    │   ├── vehicles_controller
    ├── models/
    │   ├── application_record.rb
    │   ├── mechanics.rb
    │   ├── repairs.rb
    │   ├── vehicles.rb
    ├── views/
        ├── layouts
        ├── mechanics
        ├── repairs
        ├── sessions
        ├── vehicles
```

I find this still relatively still difficult but I am still trying.  I did have a tough time with Rails but only because that is just what happens to most students, but the prospects are exciting.  I wont drone on and maybe I will on the next to last blog I create for this course, but here's what I learned from the begining till now.   I learned that I can be both easy and hard.  Like the work is the work and its only evolving but you can dive deep and deeper into trying to understand and there will always be someone out there that can help along the way.  I think thats the best part about tech is that its a community and always will be unless you want a bit of seperation.  

Well thats it for me.  I will catch you on the next one!
